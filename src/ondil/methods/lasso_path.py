class LassoPath(ElasticNetPath):
    """
    Path-based lasso estimation.

    The lasso method runs coordinate descent along a (geometric) decreasing grid of regularization strengths (lambdas).
    We automatically calculate the maximum regularization strength for which all (not-regularized) coefficients are 0.
    The lower end of the lambda grid is defined as $$\\lambda_\min = \\lambda_\max * \\varepsilon_\\lambda.$$

    We allow to pass user-defined lower and upper bounds for the coefficients.
    The coefficient bounds must be an `numpy` array of the length of `X`
    respectively of the number of variables in the equation _plus the intercept, if
    you fit one_. This allows to box-constrain the coefficients to a certain range.

    Furthermore, we allow to choose the start value, i.e. whether you want an update
    to be warm-started on the previous fit's path or on the previous reguarlization
    strength or an average of both. If your data generating process is rather stable,
    the `"previous_fit"` should give considerable speed gains, since warm starting on
    the previous strength is effectively batch-fitting.

    Lastly, we have some rather technical parameters like the number of coordinate
    descent iterations, whether you want to cycle randomly and for which tolerance
    you want to break. We use active set iterations, i.e. after the first
    coordinate-wise update for each regularization strength, only non-zero
    coefficients are updated.

    We use `numba` to speed up the coordinate descent algorithm.
